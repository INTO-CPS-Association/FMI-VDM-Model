How to create FMI2 and FMI3 VDM-SL projects in Overture
=======================================================

The FMIn and FMIn_API projects are the main Overture projects in this repository. They are referenced by other projects.
But since Overture does not support direct VDM-SL project references, this has to be achieved by hand.

For example, when extracting the FMI2_API itself from Git, there will be unresolved symbols for the FMI2 project. To
resolve these, an FMI2 folder must be created and filled with *links* to the FMI2 project files:

1. Download the FMI2_API project from Git.
2. Create an "FMI2" folder in the project (right-click project then New/Folder, if it does not exist)
3. Right click the new folder and "Import", "File System" and locate the FMI2 project
4. Select all of the top-level *.vdmsl files, but not the subfolders or .project/.ignore files etc.
5. Under the Advanced button, select "Create links in workspace" and "Create links relative to PROJECT_LOC"

This will then populate the folder with links to the FMI2 project files, which are hence automatically up to date if
those files change in the other project.
