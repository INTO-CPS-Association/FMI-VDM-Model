To build the VDMCheck distribution package, use Maven with the package or install goal.

The package is called vdmcheck-<version>-distribution.zip, and is located in the target folder
after the build.

To install the package, unzip the distribution ZIP somewhere and call the VDMCheck.sh bash
script, passing the FMU file to be processed.
