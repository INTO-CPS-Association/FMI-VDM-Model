How to populate this folder
===========================

1. Right click the folder and "Import", "File System" and locate the FMI2 project
2. Select all of the top-level *.vdmsl files, but not the subfolders or .project/.ignore files etc.
3. Under the Advanced button, select "Create links in workspace" and "Create links relative to PROJECT_LOC"

This will then populate the folder with links to the FMI2 project files, which are hence automatically up to date if
those files change in the other project.
