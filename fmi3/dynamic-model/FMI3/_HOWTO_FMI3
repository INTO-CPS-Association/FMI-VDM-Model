How to populate this folder in Overture
=======================================

1. Right click the FMI2 folder and "Import", "File System" and locate the fmi3/static-model project
2. Select all of the top-level *.vdmsl files, but not the subfolders or .project/.ignore files etc.
3. Under the Advanced button, select "Create links in workspace" and "Create links relative to PROJECT_LOC"

This will then populate the folder with links to the static-model project files, which are hence automatically
up to date if those files change in the other project.

How to populate this folder in VSCode
=====================================

1. In a bash shell, navigate to the dynamic-model/FMI3 folder
2. Run the command: ln -s ../../static-model/*.vdmsl .
3. These should appear after a refresh (F5) in Overture and work as expected in VSCode

The process is similar in Windows, but using Symlinks via the File Explorer.
