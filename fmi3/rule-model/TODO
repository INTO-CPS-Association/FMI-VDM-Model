# Things that still need to be done!

. Should we be using effective record values for all tests?
. If not (above), probably need a raw/effective naming convention
. Add better "explanations" to some @OnFail messages
. Split multi-part rules into individual tests?
. Check proof obligations for problem hints
. Complete embedding/linking of rules in FMI3Rules.adoc
. Review the model with FMI group.
