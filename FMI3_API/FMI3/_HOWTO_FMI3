How to populate this folder in Overture
=======================================

1. Right click the folder and "Import", "File System" and locate the FMI3 project
2. Select all of the top-level *.vdmsl files, but not the subfolders or .project/.ignore files etc.
3. Under the Advanced button, select "Create links in workspace" and "Create links relative to PROJECT_LOC"

This will then populate the folder with links to the FMI3 project files, which are hence automatically up to date if
those files change in the other project.


How to populate this folder in VSCode
=====================================

1. In a bash shell, navigate to the FMI3_API/FMI3 folder
2. Run the command: ln -s ../../FMI3/*.vdmsl .
3. These should appear after a refresh (F5) in Overture

The process is similar in Windows, but using Symlinks via the File Explorer.
